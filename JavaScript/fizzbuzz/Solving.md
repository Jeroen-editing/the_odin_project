Fizz Buzz


Write a program that prints each number 
betweeen 1 and 
the given number => entered by the user.

For the numbers that divide by 3 (without a remainder)
it prints 'Fizz' instead.
For the numbers that divide by 5 (without a remainder)
it prints 'Buzz' instead.
For the numbers that divide by 3 and 5 (without a remainder)
it prints 'FizzBuzz' instead.



Task is nomaly for console only.
But I want a user interface.

So I need a form with an input (number) and a submit button.


I also want the result in a nice interface under the form.


Desired output =  a list of numbers from 1 to the 'given number and
each number that divide by 3 wil be replaced by 'Fizz',
each number that divide by 5 wil be replaced by 'Buzz' and
each number that divide by 3 & 5 wil be replaced by 'FizzBuzz'.


Pseudo Code:

When a user inputs a number Loop from 1 to the entered number If the current number is divisible by 3 then print "Fizz" If the current number is divisible by 5 then print "Buzz" If the current number is divisible by 3 and 5 then print "FizzBuzz" Otherwise print the current number.


First step:

create a possible input and see it's an integer.
so make a form for it and see it's submitted (to the js-file)
