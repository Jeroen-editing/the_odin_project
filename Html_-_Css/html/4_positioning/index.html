            Alan Guth was one of the first physicists to hypothesize the existence of inflation, which explains how 
            the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.

                CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth,
                with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and 
                equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
            </p>
            <p class="textPart">
                He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have 
                been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to 
                begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space 
                itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster 
                than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.

                If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole 
                to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles 
                and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like 
                spit in the ocean.

                On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning 
                of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

                Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="">the first sliver of cosmic time</a> with telescopes at the 
                South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics 
                detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called <a href="">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a universe 
                being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second 
                old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, 
                that Dr. Guth was correct.

                Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether 
                it could ever be proved.
            </p>
            <p class="textPart">
                If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery of 
                dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and 
                space and energy to science and speculation.
            </p>
            <p class="textPart">
                Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its 
                hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture 
                and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other universes 
                bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.

                In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the reach 
                of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the 
                first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, 
                should ruffle space-time.

            <p class="textPart">
                Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team, said, 
                “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
            </p>
            <p class="textPart">
                He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”

            <p class="textPart">
                The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates space and 
                preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.

                Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic 
                Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a 
                set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

                The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear 
                of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at 
                Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.

                “It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully

                Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, 
                in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s 
                team, <a href="">knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne</a> to tell him the news.

                Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.

            <p class="textPart">
                “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did not think that we ordered anything, but 
                I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in an email.
            </p>
            <p class="textPart">
                Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best 
                way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.
            </p>
            <p class="textPart">
                By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news spread, astrophysicists responded with 
                a mixture of jubilation and caution.
