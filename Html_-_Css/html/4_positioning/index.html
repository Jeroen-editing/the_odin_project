                CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth,
                with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and 
                equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.

                He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have 
                been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to 
                begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space 
                itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster 
                than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.

                If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole 
                to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles 
                and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like

                Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether 
                it could ever be proved.

                If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery of 
                dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and

                Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its

                and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other universes 
                bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.

                The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear

                Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.

                Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best

                In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was polarized, meaning 
                the light waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.

                This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from inflation. Such 
                waves, squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the 
                direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization 
                in the sky should have little arrows going in spirals.

                Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the temperature of 
                the microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.

                “We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.

                The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year burning up time on a Harvard 
                supercomputer, making sure they had things right and worrying that competitors might beat them to the 
                breakthrough.
